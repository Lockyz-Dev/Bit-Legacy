## Please Remember
While the plan was to only do two BIG updates for v3.0.0 there is a possibility some features may come in a future update after wave 2.

## Planned ETA
I plan on getting this update done BEFORE Quarter 3 of 2021. Please remember that there is still a possibility that this won't happen.

## Beta Testing
I'm opting to not have a closed beta this time, all features will be added as their made but will be premium only features.

[^1]: Premium ONLY feature.
